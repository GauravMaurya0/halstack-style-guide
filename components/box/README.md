# Overview

There are different ways to organise the content on the webpage to facilitate the user according to his nature of interaction with the content like forms, tables, lists etc. One of the best ways to organise the webpage is by using groups of related content, this can be achieved by using a dedicated Box component.

# Appearance

Just as the name indicates the content in the webpage can be grouped using the Box Component, which is a simple wrapper component used to organise the layout within the box container.

The Box component can be Decorated by using its pre-set CSS properties like margins, padding, borders, shadows, background colors etc. and organise the layout design consisting of interactive / non-interactive components like icons, labels, paragraphs and buttons etc as described in the design specifications. Based on the interaction CSS Animation can be performed as required.

# States

## Default:
Only light grey/white background can be used with no shadow.

## Mouse Over:
On mouse over the box container can show a very light grey background and a light shadow to indicate the component is in focus.

## On Mouse Click (Focus):
When the group is in focus the 1px outline can be applied with the primary colour with a darker shadow.

# Design specifications

# User interface considerations

* Organise the group layout with the information presented clearly by applying the styles in the box container
* If required, the same group can be replicated using styles multiple iterations
