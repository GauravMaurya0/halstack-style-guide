================= LIGHT =================

Button Light Basic,Raised default:
- The default color of the text is not all black, it has an opacity of 87%, please make it all black (#000)

Button Light Basic clicked/animation:
- The dark grey is not exactly the color in the design (#666666) is a little bit darker.
Maybe it is related with some opacity of the ripple.

Button Light Basic,Raised disabled:
- The color of the text is dark grey (#666), but we already have the opacity in the button, so the color used
for the text must be pure black (#000)
- A not-allowed cursor hover is missing in the disabled button

Button Light Flat hover:
- The color on hover action should be #D9D9D9

Button Light Flat,Outlined clicked/animation:
- The color used for the ripple is wrong, it should be #EEEEEE

Button Light Outlined disabled:
- It shouldn't have any opacity, the color of the text and the border
should be #D9D9D9

================= DARK =================

Button Basic,Raised default:
- The color of the text should be pure black (#000000, no opacity)

Button Flat hover:
- Color -> #D9D9D9 (to keep consistency)

Button Flat animation/clicked:
- Color -> #FFFFFF to make it more visible in the dark theme

Button Outlined animation/clicked:
- Color -> #212121 (the same that we use for the basic in hover)

================= WITH ICON =================

Button with icon Basic/Raised default:
- Icon color is not corrected on hover
- With the dark theme, the icon is not visible using the
outlined and flat mode because it is keeping a black color (change it accordingly)
