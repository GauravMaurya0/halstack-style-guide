  Halstack Design System
</h1>

Halstack Design System is a set of visual principles, guidelines, 
and tools aimed at helping designers and developers to build visually 
consistent and compelling API-driven User Experiences that adhere 
to our unique branded visual identity. 

We have our components available for the following technologies:

- [Angular](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-angular)
- [React](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-react)

## Getting started

- The UI-Kit requires having the latest version of XD installed.
- Download the latest version of the Halstack UI-Kit from [here](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/tree/master/Halstack%20UI-Kit).
- Use the components and core visual styles to build out your design.

## UI-Kit

We are currently working in an Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) public library. Until it is finished download the file and use it as a sticker sheet.

**UI-Kit best practices**

Open the UI-Kit XD document and [publish the library](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/design-systems/cloud-libraries/best-practices-creative-cloud-libraries.html) in order to reuse our colors, characther styles and components through all your design files.

**Font family**

The font family used in Halstack UI-Kit is Open Sans. This font is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and free to download from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text_type=custom).
