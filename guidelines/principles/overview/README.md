  Halstack Design System
</h1>

Halstack design principles are the fundamental part of DXC Technology's approach to provide guidance for development teams in order to deliver superior, beautiful but above all, functional user experiences to our customers:
 
* Balance 
* Consistency  
* Visual hierarchy 

All our components, design tokens, accessibility guidelines, responsive design techniques, and layout proposals have been carefully curated by DXC design and engineering teams with the objective of creating a unique visual language and ecosystem for our applications. This is the DXC way of creating User Experiences.



## Open Source

Halstack is an open source design system, this means that we work towards DXC technology bussines needs, but it is open for anyone to use and contribute back to.

We are charmed to receive external contributions to help us find bugs, design new features, or help us improve the project documentation. If you're interested, definitely check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/blob/master/contributing/overview.md).


## Our Assets

We mantain an [Adobe XD public library](https://shared-assets.adobe.com/link/732533f4-d925-487e-4761-9a760574cfac). In order to receive the regular updates keep your assets linked and you will receive them automatically.

We also have our components available in the following frameworks:

- [Angular](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-angular): _Mantained by DXC team_
- [React](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-react): _Mantained by DXC team_

If youâ€™re using a different framework, you can still build components by following our design guidelines.
