# Icons

Icons are symbols used for representation and identification of apps or services at a glance. Icons are most effective when they improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They guide users while they're navigating a page.

## What are Icons used for?

Icons convey immediate meaning and provide shortcuts. Reading text requires more energy than deciphering an icon. Icons can be used to allow for scanning and increase readability.

## Usage recommendations

### When to use icons?

<!--  Merge the two first subsections into one that serves as intrduction to the actionable list -->

Icons and imagery are noticed before anything else, because we can eye-scan over them faster than text.

You Should use icons When Text Labels Are Overkill. Naturally, you should use an icon when you don’t have enough space for a text label, but this isn’t always the best reason to use an icon. First you should consider creating space in other ways; this might include simplifying the layout or removing unnecessary distractions

### When Not to use icons?

You Shouldn’t use icons Simply Because, By using icons unnecessarily you’re creating more visual distractions, and too many visual distractions make it harder for the user to scan through content for useful information.

You Shouldn't use icons when the Design is crowded, However images rarely give us the information we need.

Using too many icons will become nothing more than decoration.


### Do’s

* Use icons with meaning text labels
* Use a single icon for clarity
* Use single icon per concept
* Use simple continuous line icons
* Use monochrome line icons

### Dont’s

* Icons without labels can be unclear
* Too many icons in UI create visual clutter
* Multiple icon variations should not for the same concept
* Avoid multiple/ complex icon elements with cuts inbetween
* Avoid multicolor line icons

#### SVG icon 

The primary purpose of SVG icons is to define vector-based graphics in XML format. However, for icon browsers consider them as text, so the icons are anti-aliased. With inline SVGs, they are vectors with no anti-aliasing issues even at small sizes, and they look crisper on retina displays.

#### PNG icon

A PNG file is an image saved in the Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format, commonly used to store web graphics, digital photographs, and images with transparent backgrounds. It is a raster graphic similar to a . JPG image but is compressed with lossless compression and supports transparency. The advantages of the PNG format include: Lossless compression -- doesn't lose detail and quality after image compression. Supports a large number of colors -- the format is suitable for different types of digital images, including photographs and graphics.

Raster formats like PNG become pixilated when resized. SVG graphics are resolution-independent. Other image formats may require extra assets/data to fix resolution-based issues, depending on the device. For example, in retina screens, a @2x hack is required to display higher-resolution images.

### Size



<!-- | Size | Description | -->

<!-- Size --> #### 16px (small) 

<!-- Description --> Small icons are best used when space is limited. We use small icons in our components such as a chevron-down in the select component or a cross-circle-filled in populated text fields.

#### 24px (medium)

Medium icons are used in the majority of our interface. These are our standard size.

#### 32px (large)

Large icons are used sparingly to emphasize a concept or when space is plentiful. Wherever it’s used, consider the fidelity of the icon in the space it’s being used.
