## Markdown

Our documentation pages are written in markdown. [Check the markdown guide for the basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Writing content

* Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
* Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words.
* Use sentence case for everything, including component names

## Sections

Our components documentation is divided in 4 main different sections:

* **Introduction**: Brief description of the component.
* **Usage**: How the component should be used.
* **Anatomy**: All the individual elements that are part of the component.
* **Design specs**: How the component is built.

Other sections to consider adding to a component documentation:

* States
* Variants
* Placement and aligment
* Behavior and interaction
* Content
* Accessibility
