## Design

### Halstack UI Kit

The Halstack UI Kit is available in two forms:

* [Public XD libary](https://shared-assets.adobe.com/link/732533f4-d925-487e-4761-9a760574cfac)
* [UI Kit versioned file](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/raw/master/Halstack%20UI-Kit/UI%20Kit-Halstack_v3.6.0.xd)

At the moment we only have built our library in Adobe XD, if you are interested in contributing by creating the library in another design tool go to 

### Reusing styles across XD documents

There are two options in order to reuse the styles:

* Using the public library
* Publishing a local library from the UI-kit versioned file

Unless you are working on the library itself is recommneded to use the public library in order to reuse the design assets in other files. **You will receive the updates automatically in your working files**. 

If you development team is working with a **previous version of the latest released Halstack CDK**, you can find all the UI Kit files in the [previous releases folder](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/tree/master/previous-releases) (Note that if you need to upgrade the version of the components you are using you will need to delete all the instances and relink the again with the proper version/public library)


### Design assets

Between the design assets we store the .xd files for every component documentation images, principles and another useful files as branding assets. All our design assets are located [here](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/tree/master/contributing/assets).
