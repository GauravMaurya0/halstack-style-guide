## Design

### Halstack UI Kit

The Halstack UI Kit is available in two forms:

* [Public XD libary](https://shared-assets.adobe.com/link/732533f4-d925-487e-4761-9a760574cfac)
* [UI Kit versioned file](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/raw/master/Halstack%20UI-Kit/UI%20Kit-Halstack_v3.6.0.xd)

:exclamation: **Unless you are working on the library itself is recommneded to use the public library in order to reuse the design assets in other files**

Only the mantainers have access to the public library file. In order to request access contact with @aweell or @jsardid.

### Reusing styles across XD documents


### Design assets

Between the design assets we store the .xd files for every component documentation images, principles and another useful files as branding assets.

All our design assets are located [here](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/tree/master/contributing/assets).
