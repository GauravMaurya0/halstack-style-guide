## Typography hierarchy
Our selected typography helps in structuring our user's experience based on the visual impact that it has on the user interface content. 
It defines what is the first noticeable piece of information or data based on the font shape, size, color, 
or type and it highlights some pieces of text over the rest. Some typographic elements used in Halstack Design System include headers, 
body, taglines, captions, and labels. Our design system leverages Open Sans font and all its variants that cover all the needs and requirements mentioned above. 
Make sure you include all the different typographic variants in order to enhance the application's content structure, including the Heading component which defines different levels of page and section titles.
