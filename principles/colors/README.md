Color is a key design element that helps in guiding the user's perception order. For example, strong colors (e.g. DXC Purple) must be used in Call to Actions (CTAs) or highly interactive components, while other lighter colors (e.g. DXC Light Grey) are assigned to elements with lower relevance in the visual interface. When UI components follow a well defined hierarchy and they are aligned with good design practices, they contribute to create a compelling, effective, and usable digital product. Every detail counts.

Also, there are other colors beyond DXC's default palette allowed in Halstack Design System. These are standard red, green, blue, and amber colors used in our User Feedback components such as error messages, alerts, and information boxes. However, these colors must not be used outside this context in other components.

Finally, Halstack Design System caters for some calculated variations of the primary palette (e.g. tints and shades) to be applied into the secondary modes of some UI components. This is because we believe that these calculated variations don't alter the proposed visual language and the overall visual attributes of the components.
