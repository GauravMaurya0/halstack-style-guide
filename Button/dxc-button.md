## DXC Button Visual Guidelines

#### Overview

Buttons are basic interface elements that initialize an action or function when the user interacts with them. The appearance of the button should suggest the user to take an action that leads to different scenarios.

These elements that reinforce to the user the necesity to interact are called CTA (Call to Action) components, which basically are designed to capture user attention and improve the user experience within the application.

##### *Appereance*

Into DXC Design System you will find several buttons with different shades, colors and sizes, each of them carefully designed following best practices to fit in every application that you want to build or integrate with this system.

###### Modes

We can identify four different modes that imply some visual changes according to color, border or shadow attributes.
Modes: __basic__, __outlined__, __raised__, __flat__.

###### States

The states are the different behaviours of the button component based in the interaction of the user.
For the desktop version, we contemplate five different states by which can pass.

States: __default__, __disabled__, __hover__, __clicked__ and __animation__.
